## What is a BadUSB Attack?

A BadUSB attack uses a device that looks like a regular USB drive but actually acts as a keyboard. When plugged in, it can type commands at superhuman speed to:

- Steal passwords
- Install malware
- Access your files
- Give attackers remote access to your computer

**The scary part:** This happens in seconds, and you might not even notice.

## The Parking Lot USB Trick

Attackers often drop USB drives in:
- Parking lots
- Lobbies
- Break rooms
- Near elevators
- Restrooms
- Conference rooms

These drives are labeled with tempting names like:
- "Confidential"
- "Salary Information"
- "Layoff List"
- "Photos"
- "Password Reset"

**Why it works:** Curiosity is a powerful motivator.
